## General / Multi-Domain Use Cases

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- **initial-exploration.md** - Getting started with a new dataset: overview, shape, missing values, data types
- **distribution-analysis.md** - Analyzing distributions, outliers, and statistical properties
- **correlation-check.md** - Finding relationships between variables

### Debugging

- **model-performance.md** - Diagnosing why a model isn't performing well
- **data-quality-issues.md** - Tracking down root causes of data anomalies

### Code Review

- **ml-code-review.md** - Reviewing ML code for quality, reproducibility, and best practices

## Using Prompts

Prompts are templates you fill in and use directly with your AI tool. Use them when:
- You're starting a new analysis or task
- You need consistent structure across team members
- You want a checklist to ensure nothing is missed

**How to use:**
1. Copy the prompt template to your work environment
2. Fill in the variables (marked as `[variable]`)
3. Paste into your AI conversation

**Example:**
```
I'm analyzing a new dataset for customer churn prediction.

[Then paste the initial-exploration.md prompt with your data details]
```

- **feature-selection.md** - Selecting features for ML models
- **error-diagnosis.md** - Systematic error analysis in notebooks
- **documentation.md** - Auto-generating documentation for analysis
