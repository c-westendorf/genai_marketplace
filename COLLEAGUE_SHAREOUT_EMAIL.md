Subject: New Data Platform Integration Toolkit - Need Your Feedback

Hi [Team Name],

We've completed Phase 2 of cursor-marketplace, and I'd love your feedback before we move forward.

## What's New

We've integrated three data platforms with your LLM tools:

✅ **Snowflake Integration** - Query your data warehouse directly from VSCode with Copilot
✅ **BigQuery Integration** - Run analytics queries and create ML models
✅ **Atlassian Integration** - Create Jira issues and Confluence docs from your analysis

All integrations work with:
- ✅ VSCode + Copilot (recommended)
- ✅ Cursor
- ✅ Claude Code
- ✅ Generic LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini)

## Example Workflow

```
Step 1: @snowflake Query customer data for anomalies
Step 2: @atlassian Create DATA project issue to track fix
Step 3: @atlassian Document findings in Confluence
Result: Complete workflow without leaving your IDE
```

## Quick Setup

- **Time required:** 30-45 minutes (per platform)
- **Complexity:** Intermediate (follow our step-by-step guides)
- **Cost:** Free (uses your existing platforms)

See [integrations/README.md](https://github.com/[org]/cursor-marketplace/blob/execution-optional/integrations/README.md) for setup guides.
