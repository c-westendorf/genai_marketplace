📢 **New Feature Alert: Data Platform Integrations** 🎯

We just launched Phase 2 of cursor-marketplace with **three new integrations**:

✅ **Snowflake** - Query your data warehouse directly from VSCode
✅ **BigQuery** - Run analytics & create ML models
✅ **Atlassian** - Create Jira issues & Confluence docs

All from **Copilot chat** in VSCode—no switching between apps!

**Example:**
```
@snowflake Query customer data for anomalies
↓
@atlassian Create DATA-123 to track the issue
↓
@atlassian Document findings in Confluence
```
